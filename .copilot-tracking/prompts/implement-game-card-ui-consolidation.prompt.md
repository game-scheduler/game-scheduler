# Implementation Prompt: Game Card UI Consolidation - Web and Discord

## Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Create Changes Tracking File

You WILL create `20251220-game-card-ui-consolidation-changes.md` in `.copilot-tracking/changes/` if it does not exist.

### Step 2: Execute Implementation

You WILL follow `.github/instructions/task-implementation.instructions.md`
You WILL systematically implement `.copilot-tracking/plans/20251220-game-card-ui-consolidation-plan.instructions.md` task-by-task
You WILL follow ALL project standards and conventions:

- `.github/instructions/reactjs.instructions.md` for all React/TypeScript code
- `.github/instructions/python.instructions.md` for all Python code
- `.github/instructions/self-explanatory-code-commenting.instructions.md` for commenting style
- `.github/instructions/taming-copilot.instructions.md` for interaction patterns

**CRITICAL**: If phaseStop is true, you WILL stop after each Phase for user review.
**CRITICAL**: If taskStop is true, you WILL stop after each Task for user review.

### Step 3: Cleanup

When ALL Phases are checked off (`[x]`) and completed you WILL do the following:

1. You WILL provide a markdown style link and a summary of all changes from `.copilot-tracking/changes/20251220-game-card-ui-consolidation-changes.md` to the user:

   - You WILL keep the overall summary brief
   - You WILL add spacing around any lists
   - You MUST wrap any reference to a file in a markdown style link

2. You WILL provide markdown style links to `.copilot-tracking/plans/20251220-game-card-ui-consolidation-plan.instructions.md`, `.copilot-tracking/details/20251220-game-card-ui-consolidation-details.md`, and `.copilot-tracking/research/20251220-game-card-ui-consolidation-research.md` documents. You WILL recommend cleaning these files up as well.

3. **MANDATORY**: You WILL attempt to delete `.copilot-tracking/prompts/implement-game-card-ui-consolidation.prompt.md`
