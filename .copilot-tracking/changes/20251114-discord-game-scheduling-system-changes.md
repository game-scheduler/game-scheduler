## Changes

### Added

- docker-compose.yml - Multi-service orchestration with postgres, rabbitmq, redis, bot, api, scheduler services
- .env.example - Environment variable template with Discord, database, and service configuration
- docker/bot.Dockerfile - Multi-stage Docker image for Discord bot service
- docker/api.Dockerfile - Multi-stage Docker image for FastAPI web service
- docker/scheduler.Dockerfile - Multi-stage Docker image for Celery scheduler service
- pyproject.toml - Project configuration with Python dependencies and tooling setup
- requirements.txt - Python package requirements for all services
- README.md - Project documentation with architecture overview and setup instructions
- .gitignore - Git ignore patterns for Python, Docker, and development files
- services/bot/ - Directory structure for Discord bot service
- services/api/ - Directory structure for FastAPI web service
- services/scheduler/ - Directory structure for Celery scheduler service
- shared/ - Directory structure for shared models and utilities

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup - Database Schema

- shared/models/base.py - SQLAlchemy base model with UTC datetime utilities
- shared/models/user.py - User model storing only discordId for Discord integration
- shared/models/guild.py - GuildConfiguration model with default game settings
- shared/models/channel.py - ChannelConfiguration model with guild-override settings
- shared/models/game.py - GameSession model with scheduling and status tracking
- shared/models/participant.py - GameParticipant model supporting both Discord users and placeholders
- shared/models/**init**.py - Model exports for shared package
- shared/database.py - Async database connection and session management utilities
- alembic/env.py - Alembic async migration environment configuration
- alembic.ini - Alembic configuration file with PostgreSQL connection settings
- alembic/script.py.mako - Alembic migration template
- alembic/versions/001_initial_schema.py - Initial database schema migration with all tables and constraints
- .env - Environment configuration file (created from .env.example)

**Database Schema Configured:**

- PostgreSQL database initialized with all 6 tables (users, guild_configurations, channel_configurations, game_sessions, game_participants, alembic_version)
- All foreign key constraints with CASCADE deletes applied
- Indexes created for performance (discord_id, guild_id, channel_id, status, created_at, game_session_id, user_id)
- CHECK constraint enforced on game_participants ensuring placeholder data integrity
- Alembic migration system verified and working

### Modified

- alembic.ini - Updated database URL to use correct credentials from .env

### Removed
