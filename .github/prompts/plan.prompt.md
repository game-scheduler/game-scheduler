title: Plan the discord game scheduling system
---

#file: .copilot-tracking/research/\*discord-game-scheduling-system-research.md
Build a plan to support implementing a discord game scheduling system based on the research in the file above. Break the plan into steps with clear goals for each step. Each step should be small enough to be implemented in a single coding session. The plan should cover all major components needed for the system to function, including backend API endpoints, database schema changes, and frontend UI components.
