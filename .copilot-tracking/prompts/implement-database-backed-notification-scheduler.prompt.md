# Implementation Prompt: Database-Backed Event-Driven Notification Scheduler

## Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Create Changes Tracking File

You WILL create `20251127-database-backed-notification-scheduler-changes.md` in #file:../changes/ if it does not exist.

### Step 2: Execute Implementation

You WILL follow #file:../../.github/instructions/task-implementation.instructions.md
You WILL systematically implement #file:../plans/20251127-database-backed-notification-scheduler-plan.instructions.md task-by-task
You WILL follow ALL project standards and conventions:

- #file:../../.github/instructions/python.instructions.md for all Python code
- #file:../../.github/instructions/containerization-docker-best-practices.instructions.md for Docker files
- #file:../../.github/instructions/self-explanatory-code-commenting.instructions.md for commenting style
- #file:../../.github/instructions/taming-copilot.instructions.md for interaction patterns

**CRITICAL**: If ${input:phaseStop:true} is true, you WILL stop after each Phase for user review.
**CRITICAL**: If ${input:taskStop:true} is true, you WILL stop after each Task for user review.

### Step 3: Cleanup

When ALL Phases are checked off (`[x]`) and completed you WILL do the following:

1. You WILL provide a markdown style link and a summary of all changes from #file:../changes/20251127-database-backed-notification-scheduler-changes.md to the user:


    - You WILL keep the overall summary brief
    - You WILL add spacing around any lists
    - You MUST wrap any reference to a file in a markdown style link

2. You WILL provide markdown style links to .copilot-tracking/plans/20251127-database-backed-notification-scheduler-plan.instructions.md, .copilot-tracking/details/20251127-database-backed-notification-scheduler-details.md, and .copilot-tracking/research/20251127-database-backed-notification-scheduler-research.md documents. You WILL recommend cleaning these files up as well.
3. **MANDATORY**: You WILL attempt to delete .copilot-tracking/prompts/implement-database-backed-notification-scheduler.prompt.md
